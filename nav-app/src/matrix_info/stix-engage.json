For example, the defender can manipulate software by changing the output of commonly used discovery commands to hide legitimate systems and artifacts and/or reveal decoy artifacts and systems.\nAlternatively, the defender can change the output of the password policy description for an adversary attempting to brute-force credentials. This manipulation may cause the adversary to waste resources brute-forcing passwords with inaccurate complexity requirements. If the defender wanted to degrade software effectiveness, they might weaken algorithms to expose data that is being archived, encoded, and/or encrypted.\nFinally, to prevent software from functioning altogether, the defender may cause software typically used to delete data or hide adversary artifacts to fail. For some Software Manipulation use cases, it may be possible to make changes in such a way that adversary actions and legitimate user actions are handled differently.
