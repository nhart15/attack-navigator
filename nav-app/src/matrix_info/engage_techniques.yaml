- &baseline
  id: EAC0019
  name: Baseline
  object-type: technique
  description: |
    Identify key system elements to establish a baseline and be prepared to reset a system to that baseline when necessary.

    To determine the system Baseline, the defender must identify software and configuration elements that are critical to a set of objectives. The defender must define the proper values and be prepared to reset a running system to its intended state. Reverting to a Baseline configuration can be essential when restoring an operational environment to a safe state or when looking to impose a cost on adversaries by preventing their technique.
    For example, the defender can watch for an adversary to make changes in the environment and then revert the environment with the goal of either forcing the adversary to target elsewhere in the network or to display a new, possibly more advanced TTP. The baseline values will also be crucial post-operation when analyzing changes to the environment over time.

- &hardware_manipulation
  id: EAC0017
  name: Hardware Manipulation
  object-type: technique
  description: |
    Alter the hardware configuration of a system to limit what an adversary can do with the device.

    Hardware Manipulation can include physical or configuration changes to the hardware in the environment. This manipulation can include physically removing a system's microphone, camera, on-board Wi-Fi adapter, etc. or using software controls to disable those devices. These types of manipulations can affect the adversary's ability to achieve their operational objectives by incurring an increased resource cost, forcing them to change tactics, or stopping them altogether.
    Hardware Manipulation is often required to maintain operational safety. For example, if the operation includes Detonating Malware using a laptop physically located in a shared space, it is likely that the defender will not have the ability to hide the legitimate conversations and individuals present in the space. Unless the defender has the ability to control the background sounds and visuals, it is likely too risky to leave the camera and microphone connected to the machine.

- &isolation
  id: EAC0020
  name: Isolation
  object-type: technique
  description: |
    Using Isolation, a defender can limit the effectiveness and scope of malicious technique and/or lower exposure to unintended risks. When a system or resource is isolated, a defender can observe adversary behaviors or tools without allowing lateral movement. For example, a defender may detonate a piece of malware on an isolated system to perform dynamic analysis without risk to other network resources.
    Determining which systems should be isolated in an operation is a critical decision when calculating acceptable operational risk. However, if the adversary expects to find an entire corporate network but instead finds only an isolated system, they may not be interested in engaging with the target. Balancing acceptable risk, believability, and operational goals is essential when determining if or when a system should be isolated.

- &network_manipulation
  id: EAC0016
  name: Network Manipulation
  object-type: technique
  description: |
    Make changes to network properties and functions to achieve a desired effect.

    Network Manipulation allows a defender to throttle network speeds, segment the network, maintain a unique IP addressing scheme, add a kill switch to cut off network access, etc. These types of manipulations can affect the adversary's ability to achieve their operational objectives by incurring an increased resource cost, forcing them to change tactics, or stopping them altogether.
    For example, a defender can limit the allowed ports or network requests to force the adversary to alter their planned C2 or exfiltration channels. As another example, a defender could allow or deny outbound SMB requests from a network to affect the success of forced authentication. Additionally, the defender can degrade network speeds and reliability to impose a resource cost as adversaries exfiltrate large quantities of data. Finally, a defender can block primary C2 domains and IPs to determine if the adversary has additional infrastructure. While there are a range of network manipulation options, in all cases, the defender has an opportunity to learn about or influence the adversaries operating in the environment.

- &security_controls
  id: EAC0018
  name: Security Controls
  object-type: technique
  description: |
    Alter security controls to make the system more or less vulnerable to attack.

    Manipulating Security Controls involves making configuration changes to a system's security settings including modifying Group Policies, disabling/enabling autorun for removable media, tightening or relaxing system firewalls, etc. Such security controls can be tightened to dissuade or prevent adversary technique. Conversely, security controls can be weakened or left overly permissive to encourage or enable adversary technique.
    Tightening security controls can typically be done by implementing any of the mitigations described in MITRE ATT&CK. See https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/enterprise/ for a full list of mitigation strategies. While loosening security controls may seem obvious (i.e., simply don't employ a given mitigation strategy), there is an additional level of nuance that must be considered. Some security controls are considered so routine that its absence may be suspicious.
    For example, completely turning off Windows Defender would likely raise the adversary's suspicion. However, it is possible to turn off Windows Defender in certain shared drives to encourage adversary technique in predetermined locations. Therefore, it will likely be far less suspicious to turn off Windows Defender in a single directory or share. When assessing the likelihood that removing a given security control is overly suspicious, it is important to consider how prevalent that security control is, the target adversary's sophistication, and the deception story.

- &attack_vector_migration
  id: EAC0021
  name: Attack Vector Migration
  object-type: technique
  description: |
    Move a malicious link, file, or device from its intended location to a decoy system or network for execution/use.

    When a defender Migrates an Attack Vector, the defender intercepts a malicious element and moves it to a safe environment, such as a decoy system within a decoy network, for continued engagement or analysis. A defender may choose to migrate attack vectors, which may appear in the form of phishing emails, suspicious email attachments, or malicious USBs. For example, a defender might move a suspicious attachment from a corporate inbox to an inbox on a system that, while in the corporate IP space, is completely segmented from the enterprise network. This segregated environment will allow the adversary to move laterally throughout the environment without risk to enterprise resources.
    Determining when an engagement should be moved to an engagement environment is a critical decision when calculating acceptable operational risk. However, if the adversary sent a custom malware sample to a phishing victim, but ultimately find themselves on an unrelated victim, they may be suspicious. Balancing this acceptable risk, believability, and operational goals is essential when determining if or when to migrate an attack vector.

- &email_manipulation
  id: EAC0009
  name: Email Manipulation
  object-type: technique
  description: |
    Modify the flow of email in the environment.

    Email Manipulation covers the various ways email flows in the environment can be affected. Email Manipulation can affect which mail appliances process mail flows, where mail is forwarded, or what mail is present in an inbox. A common use case for email manipulation is as a vector to introduce malware into the engagement environment.
    Suspicious emails may be removed from production mailbox and placed into an inbox in an engagement environment. Then, any suspicious attachments or links could be detonated from within the environment. As another example, emails collected over a long period of time from a legitimate inbox outside the environment may be moved into the environment to reassure the adversary of the environment's legitimacy by creating a mailbox that more closely resembles a real, lived-in inbox.

- &introduced_vulnerabilities
  id: EAC0023
  name: Introduced Vulnerabilities 
  object-type: technique
  description: |
    Intentionally introduce vulnerabilities into the environment for the adversary to exploit.

    By intentionally Introducing Vulnerabilities into the engagement environment, the defender can attempt to motivate the adversary to target specific resources. This targeting may serve to move the adversary towards a particular resource, or away from another resource. At other times, the defender may Introduce Vulnerabilities as amean of encouraging the adversary to reveal targeting preferences, available capabilities, or even to influence future targeting decisions. The operational objectives will drive how and why the defender Introduces Vulnerabilities in the engagement environment.

-  &lures
  id: EAC0005
  name: Lures
  object-type: technique
  description: |
    Deceptive systems and artifacts intended to serve as decoys, breadcrumbs, or bait to elicit a specific response from the adversary.

    Lures are intended to elicit a particular response from the adversary. For example, the defender may utilize Lures to enable or block adversary's intended action or encourage or discourage a specific action or response. Lures can take a veriety of forms including credentials, accounts, files/directories, browser extensions/bookmarks, system processes, etc. Regardless of form, Lures provide opportunities to the defender to drive adversary behavior in ways that align with operational outcomes.

- &malware_detonation
  id: EAC0013
  name: Malware Detonation
  object-type: technique
  description: |
    Execute malware under controlled conditions to analyze its functionality.

    Malware can be detonated in a controlled and safe environment. Clear goals and safety procedures should always be established before detonation to ensure that the operation is focused and safe. The malware can be detonated in an execution environment ranging from a somewhat sterile commercial malware execution appliance to a bespoke engagement environment crafted to support an extended engagement.
    Outcomes of a malware detonation operation can include new IOCs collected during dynamic analysis, additional TTPs elicited by detonating the malware in a target rich environment, and/or negative impacts to the adversary and their operation. These outcomes can be used to produce new analytics for high-fidelity analytics.

- &peripheral_management
  id: EAC0010
  name: Peripheral Management 
  object-type: technique
  description: |
    Manage peripheral devices used on systems within the network for engagement purposes.

    Peripheral Management is the administration of peripheral devices used on systems within the engagement environment. A defender can choose to allow or deny certain types of peripherals from being used on systems to either motivate or demotivate adversary technique or to direct the adversary towards specific targets. Defenders can also introduce peripherals to an adversary-controlled system to see how the adversary reacts. For example, the defender can introduce external Wi-Fi adapters, USB devices, etc. to determine if adversaries attempt to use them for exfiltration purposes.
    Additionally, peripherals provide an avenue for the defender to present new or additional information to the adversary. This information can be used to introduce an additional attack surface, motivate or demotivate adversary technique, or to further the deception story. For example, the defender may include data on a connected USB device or stage an important conversation near an externally connected camera or microphone. Depending on the contents of this data, the adversary may be encouraged to take a specific action and/or reassured about the legitimacy of the environment.
  tactics:
    - "{{direct.id}}"

- &software_manipulation
  id: EAC0014
  name: Software Manipulation
  object-type: technique
  description: |
    Make changes to a system's software properties and functions to achieve a desired effect.

    Software Manipulation allows a defender to alter or replace elements of the OS, file system, or any other software installed and executed on a system. These alterations can affect outputs, degrade effectiveness, and/or prevent the software from functioning altogether. For example, the defender can manipulate software by changing the output of commonly used discovery commands to hide legitimate systems and artifacts and/or reveal decoy artifacts and systems.
    Alternatively, the defender can change the output of the password policy description for an adversary attempting to brute-force credentials. This manipulation may cause the adversary to waste resources brute-forcing passwords with inaccurate complexity requirements. If the defender wanted to degrade software effectiveness, they might weaken algorithms to expose data that is being archived, encoded, and/or encrypted.
    Finally, to prevent software from functioning altogether, the defender may cause software typically used to delete data or hide adversary artifacts to fail. For some Software Manipulation use cases, it may be possible to make changes in such a way that adversary actions and legitimate user actions are handled differently. For example, the defender could show all files when viewed in a graphical application but hide files or introduce decoy files when viewed via a terminal command. This would allow legitimate users full access to the file system while adversaries using a reverse shell to access the target would see the manipulated the files.
