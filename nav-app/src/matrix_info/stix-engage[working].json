While loosening security controls may seem obvious (i.e., simply don't employ a given mitigation strategy), there is an additional level of nuance that must be considered. Some security controls are considered so routine that its absence may be suspicious.\nFor example, completely turning off Windows Defender would likely raise the adversary's suspicion. However, it is possible to turn off Windows Defender in certain shared drives to encourage adversary technique in predetermined locations. Therefore, it will likely be far less suspicious to turn off Windows Defender in a single directory or share.

A defender can choose to allow or deny certain types of peripherals from being used on systems to either motivate or demotivate adversary technique or to direct the adversary towards specific targets. Defenders can also introduce peripherals to an adversary-controlled system to see how the adversary reacts. For example, the defender can introduce external Wi-Fi adapters, USB devices, etc. to determine if adversaries attempt to use them for exfiltration purposes.\nAdditionally, peripherals provide an avenue for the defender to present new or additional information to the adversary. This information can be used to introduce an additional attack surface, motivate or demotivate adversary technique, or to further the deception story. For example, the defender may include data on a connected USB device or stage an important conversation near an externally connected camera or microphone. Depending on the contents of this data, the adversary may be encouraged to take a specific action and/or reassured about the legitimacy of the environment.\n",

These alterations can affect outputs, degrade effectiveness, and/or prevent the software from functioning altogether. For example, the defender can manipulate software by changing the output of commonly used discovery commands to hide legitimate systems and artifacts and/or reveal decoy artifacts and systems.\nAlternatively, the defender can change the output of the password policy description for an adversary attempting to brute-force credentials. This manipulation may cause the adversary to waste resources brute-forcing passwords with inaccurate complexity requirements. If the defender wanted to degrade software effectiveness, they might weaken algorithms to expose data that is being archived, encoded, and/or encrypted.\nFinally, to prevent software from functioning altogether, the defender may cause software typically used to delete data or hide adversary artifacts to fail. For some Software Manipulation use cases, it may be possible to make changes in such a way that adversary actions and legitimate user actions are handled differently. For example, the defender could show all files when viewed in a graphical application but hide files or introduce decoy files when viewed via a terminal command. This would allow legitimate users full access to the file system while adversaries using a reverse shell to access the target would see the manipulated the files.\n",
